Readme

This readme is a quickstart to ensure that the server is up and running in a nick of time. The instructions are straight forward.

1. Ensure you have Python installed in your machine. Python 3.9 has been used in this project. Internet connectivity is also a necessity
in case you need to install missing packages.

2. In case of a missing module or dependency, use the command 'pip install <your missing package/module>' on the command prompt.

3. Everything has been provided in the folder but you are at liberty to change the files that are stored at the static folder.
If you happen to change any of the file, ensure that you either change the new file name to match the one at the html file at the
templates folder or you change to your new folder name in the html code which is installed in the templates folder.

4. To run the project 'AS IS' basis, open the shell/terminal/command prompt and navigate to the sa.py file which is our server.
Use the command Python sa.py to start the server.

5. Once the server has started, visit the localhost:8080 to make your request or may be to ascertain that you are in deed connected.

6. You may make changes on the sa.py file to suit your needs.

7. Once you disconnect your server, you will need to manually connect it. By the virtue of the fact that we are using the 'serve.forever()'
to serve the client, you may find it difficult to stop the server by merely using the ctrl + C. In this case, you will need to terminate or rather
restart the shell.
